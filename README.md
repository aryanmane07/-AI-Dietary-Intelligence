# AI Dietary Intelligence
AI Dietary Intelligence is a full-stack AI-powered personalized dietary intelligence platform.
The project combines:
- Food image recognition
- Nutrition information
- Patient health information
- Medical report information
- Digital Twin
- Food Genome
- Food preferences and reactions
- Food history
- User feedback
- Personalized AI analysis
- AI-generated meal plans
- Meal-plan customization and versioning
- Authentication and password reset
The core idea is:
> **The suitability of a food depends on the individual user and their personal context.**
Instead of providing only generic nutrition information, the system combines food data with the user's health profile, dietary information, previous experiences, preferences, reactions, and feedback.

5. Google Gemini

The project uses:

Google Gemini API

SDK:

@google/genai

Method:

gemini.models.generateContent()

Current model:

gemini-3.5-flash

Gemini is currently used for:

1. Medical report extraction
2. Personalized food analysis
3. Meal-plan generation
4. Meal-plan customization

The Gemini API key is stored only in the backend.

React
  ↓
Express Backend
  ↓
Google Gemini

The frontend never directly exposes the Gemini API key.

The backend also handles Gemini quota errors such as HTTP 429 and RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED.

⸻

6. Hugging Face Food Recognition

Food recognition uses a locally downloaded Hugging Face food-recognition model.

The hosted Hugging Face inference API is not used.

No Hugging Face API key is required.

The important files are:

server/food_recognition.py
server/requirements.txt

The local Python environment is:

server/food-ai/

The backend executes Python using:

server/food-ai/bin/python3

through Node.js:

child_process.execFile()

Flow:

Food Image
    ↓
Express
    ↓
Python
    ↓
food_recognition.py
    ↓
Local Hugging Face Model
    ↓
Food Name + Score
    ↓
Express
    ↓
React

The exact Hugging Face model identifier is defined in:

server/food_recognition.py

It should be taken directly from that file rather than guessed.

⸻

7. USDA FoodData Central

The project uses:

USDA FoodData Central

for food and nutrition information.

The exact external endpoint currently used is:

GET https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/foods/search

The backend route is:

GET /nutrition

The request uses:

api_key
query
pageSize=5

The backend uses the first search result and extracts information such as:

* Food name
* FDC ID
* Calories
* Protein
* Carbohydrates
* Fat
* Fiber

The USDA API key is stored only in the backend.

⸻

8. Patient Profile

The patient profile stores information such as:

* Name
* Age
* Gender
* Height
* Weight
* Blood pressure
* Blood sugar
* Diseases
* Allergies
* Food preferences

Route:

POST /patients
GET /patients/user/:userId

The profile is also used to create/update the user’s Digital Twin and Food Genome.

⸻

9. Digital Twin

The Digital Twin is a persistent software representation of the user’s health and dietary context.

It can contain:

* Health profile
* Medical information
* Dietary feedback
* Feedback count
* Personal context

Routes:

GET /digital-twin/:patientName
GET /digital-twin/user/:userId

The Digital Twin provides reusable user context for personalization.

⸻

10. Food Genome

The Food Genome represents the user’s personalized relationship with food.

It stores information such as:

* Loved foods
* Liked foods
* Neutral foods
* Disliked foods
* Food reactions
* Food experiences
* Feedback
* Meal-plan feedback
* Learned patterns

The system keeps food preference separate from physical reaction.

For example:

Food: Pizza
Preference: Loved
Reaction: Acidity

A food being liked does not automatically mean that it is suitable for the user.

⸻

11. Feedback Learning

Food feedback is submitted through:

POST /food-history

Supported statuses:

loved
liked
neutral
disliked

Feedback can come from:

food-analysis
meal-planner

The feedback updates:

Food History
     ↓
Food Genome
     ↓
Digital Twin
     ↓
Future AI Context

Repeated experiences can become learned patterns.

The system distinguishes:

Preference
    ≠
Reaction
    ≠
Medical Diagnosis

The application does not automatically turn a reported reaction into a medical diagnosis or allergy.

⸻

12. Medical Reports

Medical reports can be uploaded through:

POST /medical-reports

Supported formats:

PDF
JPEG
JPG
PNG

Flow:

      ↓
Multer
      ↓
Server Storage
      ↓

      ↓
Gemini
      ↓
Structured Information
      ↓
medicalReports
      ↓
Patient Profile
      ↓
Digital Twin

Gemini is instructed to extract only information explicitly present in the report and not invent diagnoses or missing information.

⸻

13. Meal Planner

The main route is:

POST /meal-plan

Inputs include:

goal
context
customization
mealPlanId

The Meal Planner uses:

* Patient Profile
* Digital Twin
* Food Genome
* Food Genome learning
* Previous food experiences
* Previous meal plans
* Previous meal-plan feedback
* User goal
* User context
* Customization

The AI generates a personalized one-day plan containing sections such as:

* Breakfast
* Mid-Morning Snack
* Lunch
* Evening Snack
* Dinner
* Why This Plan
* Food Genome Considerations
* Alternatives
* Missing Information

⸻

14. Meal Plan Priority

The system prioritizes information approximately in this order:

1. Explicit allergies
2. Explicit dietary restrictions
3. Explicit medical information
4. Previous negative reactions
5. Repeated personal patterns
6. Nutrition
7. Food preference

This prevents a simple food preference from automatically overriding more important health or safety information.

⸻

15. Meal Plan Saving and Versioning

Generated plans are saved in MongoDB.

The backend returns:

mealPlan
mealPlanId
saved
updated

The mealPlanId connects:

Generated Plan
     ↓
Saved Plan
     ↓
Customization
     ↓
Version History
     ↓
Feedback

When a saved plan is customized:

Existing Plan
     ↓
mealPlanId
     ↓
Customization
     ↓
Gemini
     ↓
Updated Plan
     ↓
Previous Version Saved
     ↓
Same mealPlanId

Previous versions contain information such as:

mealPlan
goal
context
customization
savedAt

⸻

16. Meal Plan Feedback

Meal-plan feedback also uses:

POST /food-history

with:

source = meal-planner

The backend verifies the exact:

mealPlanId
+
authenticated userId

Feedback can update:

foodHistory
foodGenomes
mealPlans
digitalTwins

This allows meal-plan feedback to influence future personalization.

⸻

17. Authentication

The application uses a custom MongoDB-backed session system.

Session cookie:

dietary_session

Authentication flow:

Login
  ↓
Password Verification
  ↓
Generate Random Token
  ↓
SHA-256 Hash
  ↓
Store Hash in MongoDB
  ↓
HTTP-only Cookie
  ↓
Authenticated Requests

Session tokens are generated using:

crypto.randomBytes(32)

Passwords use:

bcryptjs

with cost factor:

12

Session lifetime:

Normal login: 24 hours
Remember Me: 30 days

MongoDB uses a TTL index on expiresAt.

⸻

18. Authentication Routes

POST /signup
POST /login
GET /me
POST /logout
POST /forgot-password
POST /reset-password

Signup requires:

Valid email
Password >= 8 characters

Password reset tokens are:

* Randomly generated
* SHA-256 hashed
* Valid for 30 minutes
* Sent using Nodemailer/SMTP

After a successful password reset, existing sessions are deleted.

⸻

⸻

20. MongoDB

Current database:

MongoDB

Database name:

dietaryAI

Current collections:

users
sessions
patients
digitalTwins
foodGenomes
medicalReports
foodImages
foodHistory
mealPlans

The backend owns all database operations.

The frontend never communicates directly with MongoDB.

⸻

21. Database Relationships

User
 |
 +-- Patient
 |
 +-- Digital Twin
 |
 +-- Food Genome
 |
 +-- Food History
 |
 +-- Medical Reports
 |
 +-- Food Images
 |
 +-- Meal Plans
       |
       +-- Versions
       |
       +-- Feedback

User-specific operations use userId and ownership checks.

This helps prevent one user from accessing another user’s private data.

⸻

22. Important MongoDB Indexes

The backend creates indexes for:

sessions.expiresAt
users.email
mealPlans.userId + updatedAt
mealPlans.userId + createdAt

The sessions index is a TTL index so expired sessions can be removed automatically.

⸻

23. Current Project Structure

food-ai/
= Local Python virtual environment

The Python environment should not be committed to GitHub.

⸻

24. Environment Variables

Create:

server/.env

Example:

MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
USDA_API_KEY=YOUR_USDA_API_KEY
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
SMTP_HOST=YOUR_SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=YOUR_SMTP_USERNAME
SMTP_PASSWORD=YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD
SMTP_FROM=YOUR_FROM_ADDRESS

The current backend uses:

SMTP_PASSWORD

not SMTP_PASS.

The current backend does not use:

SESSION_SECRET

and does not require:

HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY

⸻

25. Security

Never commit:

.env
API keys
MongoDB credentials
SMTP passwords

The backend keeps private credentials server-side.

Authentication uses:

HTTP-only Cookie
+
Random Session Token
+
SHA-256 Hash
+
MongoDB

Passwords use:

bcryptjs

The project also uses ownership checks for user-specific data.

⸻

34. Planned MongoDB → SQL Migration

MongoDB is the current database.

The planned next stage is migration to SQL, potentially:

PostgreSQL

or:

MySQL

The final SQL database can be selected during implementation.

The goal is to keep the frontend unchanged:

React
  ↓
Stable API
  ↓
Backend
  ↓
MongoDB

can become:

React
  ↓
Same API
  ↓
Backend
  ↓
SQL

Database-specific logic should remain inside the backend.

⸻

35. Planned RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a future enhancement.

Current architecture:

Future architecture:

User Request
     ↓
Retriever
     ↓
Relevant Context
     ↓
Gemini
     ↓
Grounded Personalized Response

Potential retrieval sources include:

* Food Genome
* Food History
* Digital Twin
* Medical information
* Previous meal plans
* Meal-plan feedback
* USDA nutrition information

The goal is to retrieve only the most relevant information instead of sending unnecessary context.

37. Project Design Principles

Personalization

Recommendations should consider the individual user.

Separation of Responsibilities

Each technology performs a specific role:

Hugging Face = Food Recognition
USDA = Nutrition Data
MongoDB = Persistence
Digital Twin = User Context
Food Genome = Food Intelligence
Gemini = AI Reasoning

Security

Sensitive credentials remain on the backend.

Feedback

User feedback becomes part of future personalization.

API-Driven Architecture

The frontend communicates with the backend through APIs.

Migration Readiness

The frontend is not coupled directly to MongoDB.

Future AI Grounding

RAG can later provide more targeted information retrieval.

⸻

38. AI Safety

The project is a dietary decision-support system.

It is not intended to replace:

* Doctors
* Dietitians
* Medical professionals
* Clinical diagnosis
* Professional medical advice

The system should not:

* Invent medical information
* Invent allergies
* Invent food reactions
* Diagnose medical conditions
* Treat user preferences as medical facts

Medical report extraction is designed to use explicitly stated information.

The Python environment must be recreated using:

python3 -m venv food-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

The important food-recognition source files are:

server/food_recognition.py
server/requirements.txt

The developer must configure their own environment variables locally.

Personalized Reasoning

Gemini currently uses:

gemini-3.5-flash

through:

@google/genai

Food recognition runs locally through:

Python
+
food_recognition.py
+
Local Hugging Face Model

The project currently uses MongoDB but is designed to support a future:

MongoDB → SQL

migration.

A future RAG layer will allow the system to retrieve relevant information from the user’s Digital Twin, Food Genome, Food History, meal plans, feedback, and nutrition data before sending context to Gemini.

The overall vision is:

Recognize

Understand
   ↓
Retrieve
   ↓
Personalize
   ↓
Recommend

Collect Feedback
   ↓
Learn
   ↓
Personalize Again

AI Dietary Intelligence is designed to evolve from a food-recognition and nutrition application into a personalized dietary intelligence platform.
